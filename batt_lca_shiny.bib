abstract = {We need new ways of thinking about, and approaching, the world's energy problems. Global energy security and access is one of the central justice issues of our time, with profound implications for happiness, welfare, freedom, equity, and due process. This book combines up-to-date data on global energy security and climate change with fresh perspectives on the meaning of justice in social decision-making. Benjamin K. Sovacool and Michael H. Dworkin address how justice theory can help people to make more meaningful decisions about the production, delivery, use, and effects of energy. Exploring energy dilemmas in real-life situations, they link recent events to eight global energy injustices and employ philosophy and ethics to make sense of justice as a tool in the decision-making process. They go on to provide remedies and policies that planners and individuals can utilize to create a more equitable and just energy future. {\textcopyright} Benjamin K. Sovacool and Michael H.

abstract = {The demand for cadmium has gradually decreased lately, because of its toxicity and consequent regulations. However, cadmium is coproduced in zinc smelters, and therefore the production of cadmium ingots and cadmium emissions are inevitably affected by zinc demand. Most of the zinc is used for galvanizing steel, and therefore it is of interest to investigate the linkage between cadmium flow and zinc and steel demand. In addition, cadmium is used for secondary batteries, Ni–Cd batteries, alloys, etc. Therefore, a substantial amount of cadmium is still being stocked and discarded in the form of products, and management of the cadmium contained in these end-of-life products is further required in the future. To describe the flow and stock of cadmium in Japan, a dynamic substance flow analysis was conducted in this study. The linkage between cadmium, zinc and steel was quantitatively expressed: 1t of galvanized steel sheet requires approximately 20kg zinc, which induces 90g cadmium in production. The emission intensity of cadmium into air was in the range 0.189–0.296g Cd/t Zn, whereas the emission intensity into water has decreased by more than 50{\%} during 2003–2008. It is likely that the in-use stock of cadmium and the amount of cadmium contained in discarded products have already passed their peak, and have decreased recently. The recovery rate of cadmium from Ni–Cd batteries has increased. However, it was estimated that 80{\%}, or 700t, of the cadmium in discarded Ni–Cd batteries, a significant proportion of the total of 840t of discarded cadmium, had still not been recovered in 2008. The discarded Ni–Cd batteries might have gone into landfill or incineration plants, or been stored away in households. To reduce cadmium emissions, recovery of used Ni–Cd batteries needs to be enhanced. The recovery rate of zinc from end-of-life products to reduce the consumption of zinc ore, which results in the decrease in primary cadmium production, also needs to be enhanced. It is also suggested that the sustainable use of cadmium, e.g., the CdTe photovoltaic systems that use cadmium as a raw material, should be investigated.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of synthetic materials in building and furnishing, the adoption of new lifestyles, the extensive use of products for environmental cleaning and personal hygiene have contributed to the deterioration of indoor air quality and introduced new sources of risk to humans. Indoor environments include home, workplaces such as offices, public buildings such as hospitals, schools, kindergartens, sports halls, libraries, restaurants and bars, theaters and cinemas and finally cabins of vehicles. Indoor environments in schools have been of particular public concern. According to recent studies, children aged between 3 and 14 spend 90 {\%} of the day indoors both in winter and summer. Moreover, children have greater susceptibility to some environmental pollutants than adults, because they breathe higher volumes of air relative to their body weights, and their tissues and organs are actively growing. In this review, the authors explore the methodological approaches used for the assessment of air quality in schools: monitoring strategies, sampling and analysis techniques and summarizing an overview of main findings from scientific literature concerning the most common pollutants found in school environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Recent literature on demand response raises questions about the long-term capacity and carbon emissions impacts of expanding its deployment. To provide economy-wide insights into how demand response, capacity planning, and carbon emissions might interact in the future, we perform economic forecasts using a computational general equilibrium model based on the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Modeling System. We develop multiple scenarios of assumptions about the load-shifting and load reduction potential of demand response based on prior literature. The results of these scenarios suggest that demand response can defer large amounts of peak capacity construction. Contrary to expectations of increased carbon intensity, the results of our scenarios also suggest that demand response will have little impact on overall carbon emissions from electric power generation. This suggests that demand response can serve as a long-term, low-cost alternative for peak-hour load balancing without increasing carbon emissions.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) can benefit public health and the climate by displacing emissions from fossil-fuelled electrical generating units (EGUs). Benefits can vary substantially by EE/RE installation type and location, due to differing electricity generation or savings by location, characteristics of the electrical grid and displaced power plants, along with population patterns. However, previous studies have not formally examined how these dimensions individually and jointly contribute to variability in benefits across locations or EE/RE types. Here, we develop and demonstrate a high-resolution model to simulate and compare the monetized public health and climate benefits of four different illustrative EE/RE installation types in six different locations within the Mid-Atlantic and Lower Great Lakes of the United States. Annual benefits using central estimates for all pathways ranged from US{\$}5.7–US{\$}210 million (US{\$}14–US{\$}170 MWh−1), emphasizing the importance of site-specific information in accurately estimating public health and climate benefits of EE/RE efforts.},

@article{Themelis2007,
abstract = {Methane gas is a by-product of landfilling municipal solid wastes (MSW). Most of the global MSW is dumped in non-regulated landfills and the generated methane is emitted to the atmosphere. Some of the modern regulated landfills attempt to capture and utilize landfill biogas, a renewable energy source, to generate electricity or heat. As of 2001, there were about one thousand landfills collecting landfill biogas worldwide. The landfills that capture biogas in the US collect about 2.6 million tonnes of methane annually, 70{\%} of which is used to generate heat and/or electricity. The landfill gas situation in the US was used to estimate the potential for additional collection and utilization of landfill gas in the US and worldwide. Theoretical and experimental studies indicate that complete anaerobic biodegradation of MSW generates about 200 Nm3 of methane per dry tonne of contained biomass. However, the reported rate of generation of methane in industrial anaerobic digestion reactors ranges from 40 to 80 Nm3 per tonne of organic wastes. Several US landfills report capturing as much as 100 Nm3 of methane per ton of MSW landfilled in a given year. These findings led to a conservative estimate of methane generation of about 50 Nm3 of methane per ton of MSW landfilled. Therefore, for the estimated global landfilling of 1.5 billion tones annually, the corresponding rate of methane generation at landfills is 75 billion Nm3. Less than 10{\%} of this potential is captured and utilized at this time. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The UK pattern is one of centralized agenda-setting and competition in which rival research contractors bid for small, pre-determined, 'bite-sized' pieces of work. By contrast, the US approach involves complex negotiations between federal energy and environmental policy agencies and semi-entrepreneurial national laboratories. How do these differing research environments influence the knowledge we have of energy efficiency? How do these organizational features affect the shaping of research agendas, the definition of research problems and the management and dissemination of resulting expertise? More specifically, what consequences do these arrangements have for the conduct of needed social science studies within this conventionally technical field? In exploring these questions, the paper identifies a variety of ways in which opportunities for inter-disciplinary are inadvertently structured by the mechanics of research management.},

abstract = {Lifetime estimation of lead–acid batteries in stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems is a complex task because it depends on the operating conditions of the batteries. In many research simulations and optimisations, the estimation of battery lifetime is error-prone, thus producing values that differ substantially from the real ones. This error can indicate that the “optimal” system selected by the optimisation tool will not be optimal. In this paper, all of the components of a PV system have been considered simultaneously to simulate the behaviour of the system. One of these important components is the battery charge controller, which significantly affects the lifetime of batteries. The results of the simulations have allowed a comparison of the most common methods of battery lifetime prediction used by simulation and/or optimisation tools with a weighted Ah-throughput method developed a few years ago. The results show that this recent method provides more accurate lifetime values. In a simulation of a real off-grid household PV system where the real battery lifetime was 6.2years, the weighted Ah-throughput model predicted a lifetime of 5.8years; however, the other methods obtained lifetimes of more than 15years. In a simulation of another PV system designed to supply the load of an alarm where the real batteries lifetime was 5.1years, the weighted Ah-throughput model predicted a lifetime of 4.4years; however, the other methods obtained lifetimes of more than nine years.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparative life cycle assessment of cumulative energy demand (CED) and global warming potential (GWP) of four stationary battery technologies: lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur, and vanadium-redox-flow. The analyses were carried out for a complete utilization of their cycle life and for six different stationary applications. Due to its lower CED and GWP impacts, a qualitative analysis of lithium-ion was carried out to assess the impacts of its process chains on 17 midpoint impact categories using ReCiPe-2008 methodology. It was found that in general the use stage of batteries dominates their life cycle impacts significantly. It is therefore misleading to compare the environmental performance of batteries only on a mass or capacity basis at the manufacturing outlet ("cradle-to-gate analyses") while neglecting their use stage impacts, especially when they have different characteristic parameters. Furthermore, the relative ranking of batteries does not show a significant dependency on the investigated stationary application scenarios in most cases. Based on the results obtained, the authors go on to recommend the deployment of batteries with higher round-trip efficiency, such as lithium-ion, for stationary grid operation in the first instance.},

abstract = {The landfilling of municipal solid waste (MSW) may cause potential environmental impacts like global warming (GW), soil contaminations, and groundwater pollution. The degradation of MSW in anaerobic circumstances generates methane emissions, and can hence contribute the GW. As the GW is nowadays considered as one of the most serious environmental threats, the mitigation of methane emissions should obviously be aimed at on every landfill site where methane generation occurs. In this study, the treatment and utilization options for the generated LFG at case landfills which are located next to each other are examined. The yearly GHG emission balances are estimated for three different gas management scenarios. The first scenario is the combined heat and power (CHP) production with a gas engine. The second scenario is the combination of heat generation for the asphalt production process in the summer and district heat production by a water boiler in the winter. The third scenario is the LFG upgrading to biomethane. The estimation results illustrate that the LFG collection efficiency affects strongly on the magnitudes of GHG emissions. According to the results, the CHP production gives the highest GHG emission savings and is hence recommended as a gas utilization option for case landfills. Furthermore, aspects related to the case landfills' extraction are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, the author offers a set of foundational principles that can scale with the evolving grid and inform policy and business decisions about its design and operations. These principles or tenets of "grid neutrality" relate to the more familiar recent discussions regarding net neutrality. The goal is not to dictate particular designs or operation of the grid, but rather to future-proof the grid with the flexibility, resilience and scalability to meet future needs. Neutrality is a fundamental, indisputable property of the network that underpins the electricity grid. As such, the tenets of grid neutrality provide a powerful means to cut through political, technological and interest-driven grid design discussions by evaluating them against immutable principles for the future electricity grid.},

This approach is applied to cross-sectional data from a comprehensive 2005 household survey representative of both urban and rural India. The objective is to determine if the energy poor are also income poor and whether and how energy policies help reduce energy poverty, independent of income. The findings suggest that in rural areas some 57{\%} of households are energy poor, versus 22{\%} that are income poor. But in urban areas the energy poverty rate is 28{\%} compared to 20{\%} that are income poor. That is, energy policies are expected to play some roles in mitigating energy poverty. We find that reducing energy poverty requires not only support for rural electrification, but also more use of modern cooking fuels such as LPG. While income growth matters, a combination of energy related programs can play an independent and substantial role in reducing energy poverty. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Energy storage may serve as a solution to the integration challenges of high penetrations of wind, helping to reduce curtailment, provide system balancing services, and reduce emissions. This study determines the minimum cost configuration of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), wind turbines, and natural gas reciprocating engines in an off-grid model. A life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to determine the system configuration needed to achieve a variety of CO2-eq emissions targets. The relationship between total system costs and life cycle emissions are used to optimize the generation mixes to achieve emissions targets at the least cost and determine when VRFBs are preferable over wind curtailment. Different greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets are defined for the off-grid system and the minimum cost resource configuration is determined to meet those targets. This approach determines when the use of VRFBs is more cost effective than wind curtailment in reaching GHG emissions targets. The research demonstrates that while incorporating energy storage consistently reduces life cycle carbon emissions, it is not cost effective to reduce curtailment except under very low emission targets (190g of CO2-eq/kWh and less for the examined system). This suggests that “overbuilding” wind is a more viable option to reduce life cycle emissions for all but the most ambitious carbon mitigation targets. The findings show that adding VRFB as energy storage could be economically preferable only when wind curtailment exceeds 66{\%} for the examined system. The results were most sensitive to VRFB costs, natural gas upstream emissions (e.g. methane leakage), and wind capital cost.},

@article{Meinrenken2014,
abstract = {Summary Life cycle assessment (LCA)-based analyses of company value chains can inspire profound modifications to products' design, material procurement, manufacturing, energy/water use, distribution, use, and disposal. However, such modifications often create trade-offs, im- proving some aspects while worsening others. How can firms decide whether or not to carry out such modifications? Or prioritize between different options to choose the one delivering the most competitive advantage? Typically, firms' metrics fall into two groups: (1) product-level metrics across the life cycle, including up- and downstream of facilities (e.g., product carbon footprints); and (2) facility-level metrics (e.g., plants' annual energy cost). Neither is sufficient for firm-wide cost-benefit analyses of modifications that affect multiple products and value-chain stages. Whereas facility-level metrics do not capture up- and downstream effects—where oftenmost cost and environmental impacts originate—life cycle methodologies are currently not mature enough to be applied at the scale of entire product portfolios. We present a pilot system of key performance indicators (KPIs) that evaluate 3,337 products across 211 brands and five countries of PepsiCo, Inc. KPIs are firm-wide, annual figures (environmental, operational, and financial) across the value chain (cradle to grave) and can be determined at any level (single product, brands, or regions). Uncertainty analysis is included. In addition to KPIs for base cases, the system characterizes KPI impacts for any considered modifications (what-if scenarios). In a detailed case study, we present background about how and why PepsiCo used the system to evaluate all aspects of a strategic value-chain modification. For 7 of the 211 brands, this resulted in avoiding an 8{\%} increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a 7{\%} to 10{\%} increase in procurement costs. It also saved PepsiCo an estimated ?200 years full-time equivalent employee time (or al- ternatively ?US{\$}30 million in LCA consultant fees) had the LCAs of the 3,337 SKUs been carried out by traditional methods. This cost efficiency of the KPI system enables consider- ing environmental impacts with more-traditional business metrics side by side. As a result, environmental impacts can be considered on a routine basis as part of integrated strategy and business planning.We discuss implementation considerations of the KPI methodology and future improvements.},

Although much of the present-day grid operates effectively without storage, cost-effective ways of storing electrical energy can help make the grid more efficient and reliable. We investigate the economics of two emerging electric energy storage (EES) technologies: sodium sulfur batteries and flywheel energy storage systems in New York state's electricity market. The analysis indicates that there is a strong economic case for EES installations in the New York City region for applications such as energy arbitrage, and that significant opportunities exist throughout New York state for regulation services. Benefits from deferral of system upgrades may be important in the decision to deploy EES. Market barriers currently make it difficult for energy-limited EES such as flywheels to receive revenue for voltage regulation. Charging efficiency is more important to the economics of EES in a competitive electricity market than has generally been recognized. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an energy management strategy for a residential microgrid comprising photovoltaic (PV) panels and a small wind turbine. The microgrid is connected to the main grid, allowing for a controlled power exchange through a battery system and its control strategy. As input data, the proposed control strategy uses the battery state of charge (SOC), the power at each microgrid node as well as the load and renewable generation forecasts. By using forecasted data and correcting any forecasting errors according to the SOC of the battery, the strategy manages to make a better use of the battery resulting in a better grid power profile. The simulation of the system using a one-year data period shows that the proposed energy management strategy results in a better grid power profile for a given storage system when compared with other state-of-the-art strategies. Finally, the proposed strategy was experimentally validated in the microgrid built in the Renewable Energy Laboratory at the UPNa.},

abstract = {We investigated the implications of behind-the-meter (BTM) generation participating in demand response (DR) programs. Specifically, we evaluated the impacts of NOx emissions from BTM generators enrolled in the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)'s reliability-based DR programs. Through analyzing the DR program enrollment data, DR event records, ozone air quality monitoring data, and emission characteristics of the generators, we found that the emissions from BTM generators very likely contribute to exceedingly high ozone concentrations in the Northeast Corridor region, and very likely account for a substantial fraction of total NOx emissions from electricity generation. In addition, a companion study showed that the emissions from BTM generators could also form near-source particulate matter (PM) hotspots. The important policy implications are that the absence of up-to-date regulations on BTM generators may offset the current efforts to reduce the emissions from peaking power plants, and that there is a need to quantify the environmental impacts of DR programs in designing sound policies related to demand-side resources. Furthermore, we proposed the concept of "Green" DR resources, referring to those that not only provide power systems reliability services, but also have verifiable environmental benefits or minimal negative environmental impacts. We argue that Green DR resources that are able to maintain resource adequacy and reduce emissions at the same time are key to achieving the cobenefits of power system reliability and protecting public health during periods with peak electricity demand.},

abstract = {In this report, McKinsey {\&} Company offers a detailed analysis of the magnitude of the efficiency potential in non-transportation uses of energy, a thorough assessment of the barriers that impede the capture of greater efficiency, and an outline of the practical solutions available to unlock the potential. The research shows that the U.S. economy has the potential to reduce annual non-transportation energy consumption by roughly 23 percent by 2020, eliminating more than {\$}1.2 trillion in waste well beyond the {\$}520 billion upfront investment (not including program costs) that would be required. The reduction in energy use would also result in the abatement of 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually the equivalent of taking the entire U.S. fleet of passenger vehicles and light trucks off the roads. Such energy savings will be possible, however, only if the United States can overcome significant sets of barriers. These barriers are widespread and persistent, and will require an integrated set of solutions to overcome them including information and education, incentives and financing, codes and standards, and deployment resources well beyond current levels. In addition to the above central conclusion, five observations will be relevant to a national debate about how best to pursue energy efficiency opportunities of the magnitude identified and within the timeframe considered in this report. Specifically, an overarching strategy would need to: Recognize energy efficiency as an important energy resource that can help meet future energy needs while the nation concurrently develops new no- and low-carbon energy sources Formulate and launch at both national and regional levels an integrated portfolio of proven, piloted, and emerging approaches to unlock the full potential of energy efficiency Identify methods to provide the significant upfront funding required by any plan to capture energy efficiency Forge greater alignment between utilities, regulators, government agencies, manufacturers, and energy consumers Foster innovation in the development and deployment of next-generation energy efficiency technologies to ensure ongoing productivity gains.},

abstract = {The increases in a country's energy capacity are related to its gross domestic product (GDP). In Brazil, increases in income and the consumption of goods and services have led to an increase in the generation of solid waste (SW), which is sent to landfills as a method of treatment and final disposal. The purpose of this study was to facilitate an increase in energy generation from renewable resources, specifically from landfills via thermal biogas plants, and the research was divided into two phases. The first phase involved the assessment of the potential population size contributing to the landfill, which could result in the installation of a financially viable enterprise to generate electricity in Brazil. Next, an estimate of the costs associated with the generation and collection of solid waste in Brazil was predicted by GDP prognoses, the latter being in accordance with the National Energy Balance (Balan{\c{c}}o Energ{\'{e}}tico Nacional - BEN) plan created by the Mines and Energy Ministry of Brazil (Minist{\'{e}}rio de Minas e Energia do Brasil - MME). The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) of each enterprise scenario was used in the first stage to assess the plan's financial viability. In the second stage, estimation curves such as logistics, decreasing rate of growth, and logarithmic curves were used to establish relationships between the generation scenarios and the projected collection of SW and projected GDP. Thus, a range of possible landfill biogas/methane generation values and installed energy capacities were created, considering the extreme maximum and minimum values. These values were related to the energy sources from residual fuels reported by BEN. The results demonstrated that such values still represented a small percentage (0.00020{\%} in 2010 and 0.44496-0.81042{\%} in 2030) of the projected energy generation from residual fuels. Thus, an urgent need was identified to formulate policies that would encourage landfills as a source of renewable energy, broadening the number of financially viable initiatives for energy generation from landfill biogas for populations of fewer than 200,000 inhabitants. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Peak demand on electricity grids is a growing problem that increases costs and risks to supply security. Residential sector loads often contribute significantly to seasonal and daily peak demand. Demand response projects aim to manage peak demand by applying price signals and automated load shedding technologies. This research investigates voluntary load shedding in response to information about the security of supply, the emission profile and the cost of meeting critical peak demand in the customers' network. Customer willingness to change behaviour in response to this information was explored through mail-back survey. The diversified demand modelling method was used along with energy audit data to estimate the potential peak load reduction resulting from the voluntary demand response. A case study was conducted in a suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, where electricity is the main source for water and space heating. On this network, all water heating cylinders have ripple-control technology and about 50{\%} of the households subscribe to differential day/night pricing plan. The survey results show that the sensitivity to supply security is on par with price, with the emission sensitivity being slightly weaker. The modelling results show potential 10{\%} reduction in critical peak load for aggregate voluntary demand response.},

abstract = {There is a fast growing interest in better understanding the energy performance of PV technologies as evidenced by a large number of recent studies published on this topic. The goal of this study was to do a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the embedded energy, energy payback time (EPBT), and energy return on energy invested (EROI) metrics for the crystalline Si and thin film PV technologies published in 2000–2013. A total of 232 references were collected of which 11 and 23 passed our screening for EPBT/EROI and embedded energy analysis, respectively. Several parameters were harmonized to the following values: Performance ratio (0.75), system lifetime (30 years), insolation (1700kWh m−2 yr−1), module efficiency (13.0{\%} mono-Si; 12.3{\%} poly-Si; 6.3{\%} a:Si; 10.9{\%} CdTe; 11.5{\%} CIGS). The embedded energy had a more than 10-fold variation due to the variation in BOS embedded energy, geographical location and LCA data sources. The harmonization narrowed the range of the published EPBT values. The mean harmonized EPBT varied from 1.0 to 4.1 years; from lowest to highest, the module types ranked in the following order: cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), amorphous silicon (a:Si), poly-crystalline silicon (poly-Si), and mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si). The mean harmonized EROI varied from 8.7 to 34.2. Across different types of PV, the variation in embedded energy was greater than the variation in efficiency and performance ratio suggesting that the relative ranking of the EPBT of different PV technology today and in the future depends primarily on their embedded energy and not their efficiency.},

This control strategy provides an immediate and stepped power demand reduction through shutting chiller(s) down when requested. The results show that the power demand reduction and building indoor temperature during the DR event can be predicted accurately. The power demand reduction is stable which is more predictable for the grid management. The building indoor temperature rise is restrained and indoor thermal comfort is improved through use of a small scale active storage system during the DR event. The incentive bought by an existing DR program is used to calculate the economic benefit of the demand reduction controlled by the developed fast DR strategy. In addition, an electricity price structure in South China is introduced to calculate the cost saving potentials of the active storages, when a storage-priority control is used to shift peak demand in normal days. The results show that small scale active storages can also offer significant life-cycle cost saving for building demand management.},

It serves as a resource to utilities, regulators, and stakeholders who are interested in VOS program design and implementation. The report begins by characterizing solar markets under the VOS construct and assesses the economic viability of distributed solar projects under hypothetical VOS rate scenarios, for a wide variety of locations across the United States. This sets the groundwork for a discussion of specific VOS program design elements and decisions, such as how the VOS rate is applied, how VOS rate adjustments are made, and potential interactions with other solar incentives.},

abstract = {Demand response (DR) is one of many approaches to address temporal mismatches in demand and supply of grid electricity. More common in the commercial sector, DR usually refers to reducing consumption at certain hours or seasons, thus reducing peak demand from the grid. In the residential sector, where sophisticated appliance-level controls such as automatic dimming of lights or on-demand lowering of air conditioning are less common, building-based electricity storage to shift grid consumption from peak to off-peak times could provide DR without requiring consumers to operate their appliances on shifted or reduced schedules: Storage would be dispatched to appliances as needed while still shaving peaks on the grid. Technologically, storage and two-way-inverters are readily available to enable such residential DR. Economically, however, the situation is less clear. Specifically, are time-varying electricity tariffs available such that electricity cost reduction via arbitrage could offset manufacturing, financing, and installation costs of the required storage? To address this question we (i) devise an agent-based appliance-level stochastic model to simulate the electricity demand of an average U.S. household; (ii) loadshift the demand via simple dispatch strategies; and (iii) determine potential profits to the building owner, i.e. reduced electricity cost of the modified demand with realistic tariffs (Con Edison, NY) minus storage cost. We determine the economic viability for a range of traditional and advanced storage technologies as well as their optimum storage capacities to maximize profits. We find that (i) profits can range from {\textless}1{\%} to 48{\%} of annual electricity costs of a typical household; and (ii) optimum capacities, while approximately equal to households' kWh consumption during peak hours, is affected by stochastic variations in daily and seasonal consumption. Future improvements to storage technology, arbitrage strategies, and tariffs are discussed. Details of the storage technologies, agent-based model, testing, and benchmarking are supplied as Supplementary Data. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Substance flow analysis (SFA) of cadmium in Korea was carried out to analyze and predict cadmium flows, stocks, and future flows using both static and dynamic models. Cadmium is widely used in industry due to its strong corrosion and chemical resistance at high temperature, excellent electrical conduction, and low melting-point. Cadmium is produced as a by-product from the production processes for zinc and lead ingots. It is used for Ni-Cd batteries, polyvinylchloride (PVC) stabilizers, alloy products, pigments, and others. This examines the current cadmium flows and stocks using static SFA, and aims in predicting the future cadmium flows and stocks in Korea using dynamic SFA. From the static model, 2820 tonnes of cadmium ingots were produced, 0.04 tonnes imported and 2740 tons exported in Korea in 2009. In addition, 81 tonnes of cadmium were used in the manufacture of cadmium products: 80 tonnes for cadmium alloy products and 1 tonne for others. Finally, 175 tonnes of cadmium were imported into Korea for Ni-Cd batteries, 140 tonnes for PVC stabilizers, and 55 tonnes for pigments. Cadmium was used in various industries such as construction (221 tonnes), electrics and electronics (130 tonnes - including cadmium in imported products), transportation (30 tonnes) and others (30 tonnes). In 2009, 430 tonnes of industrial cadmium were discharged, with 10 tonnes being recycled and 420 tonnes discarded. From the dynamic model, cadmium stocks in Korea were estimated to be about 5120 tonnes in 2009. The industrial consumption in 2030 will be reduced to only 110 tonnes, only 27{\%} of the current consumption of 410 tonnes in 2009, due to DIRECTIVE 2002/95/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS). One possible solution to the Cd oversupply problem is use in cadmium telluride photovoltaic (CdTe PV) systems which have low life cycle Cd emissions (0.02 g Cd/GWh) and high end-of-life semiconductor recycling yields (95{\%}).

abstract = {Hybrid microgrid systems are an emerging tool for rural electrification due in part to their purported environmental benefits. This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of a diesel/PV/wind hybrid microgrid on the island of Koh Jig, Thailand with the electrification alternatives of grid extension and home diesel generators. The impact categories evaluated are: acidification potential (kg SO2 eq), global warming potential (kg CO2 eq), human toxicity potential (kg 1.4 DCB eq), and abiotic resource depletion potential (kg Sb eq). The results show that the microgrid system has the lowest global warming and abiotic resource depletion potentials of all three electrification scenarios. The use phase of the diesel generator and the extraction of copper are shown to significantly contribute to the microgrid's environmental impacts. The relative environmental impacts of the grid extension scenario are found to be proportional to the distance required for grid extension. Across all categories except acidification potential, the impacts from the home diesel generators are the largest. Sensitivity analyses show that maximizing the renewable energy fraction does not necessarily produce a more environmentally sustainable electrification scenario and that the diesel generator provides versatility to the system by allowing power production to be scaled significantly before more technology is needed to meet demand. While the environmental benefits of the microgrid increase as the installation community becomes more isolated, the choice of electrification scenario requires assigning relative importance to each impact category and considering social and economic factors.},

abstract = {Meeting time-varying peak demand poses a key challenge to the U.S. electricity system. Building-based electricity storage – to enable demand response (DR) without curtailing actual appliance usage – offers potential benefits of lower electricity production cost, higher grid reliability, and more flexibility to integrate renewables. DR tariffs are currently available in the U.S. but building-based storage is still underutilized due to insufficiently understood cost-effectiveness and dispatch strategies. Whether DR schemes can yield a profit for building operators (i.e., reduction in electricity bill that exceeds levelized storage cost) and which particular storage technology yields the highest profit is yet to be answered. This study aims to evaluate the economics of providing peak shaving DR under a realistic tariff (Con Edison, New York), using a range of storage technologies (conventional and advanced batteries, flywheel, magnetic storage, pumped hydro, compressed air, and capacitors). An agent-based stochastic model is used to randomly generate appliance-level demand profiles for an average U.S. household. We first introduce a levelized storage cost model which is based on a total-energy-throughput lifetime. We then develop a storage dispatch strategy which optimizes the storage capacity and the demand limit on the grid. We find that (i) several storage technologies provide profitable DR; (ii) annual profit from such DR can range from 1{\%} to 39{\%} of the household's non-DR electricity bill; (iii) allowing occasional breaches of the intended demand limit increases profit; and (iv) a dispatch strategy that accounts for demand variations across seasons increases profit further. We expect that a more advanced dispatch strategy with embedded weather forecasting capability could yield even higher profit.},

abstract = {While photovoltaic (PV) technology is considered a renewable energy source, it nonetheless has a degree of environmental impact. In order to completely capture the net environmental gain of a PV system, its necessary to conduct a life cycle analysis (LCA). This paper attempts to summarise the latest developments of two prominent crystalline, i.e. single crystalline (sc-) and multi crystalline (mc-) silicon PV systems with regards to their environmental performance and sustainability. The PV life cycle is assumed to begin at pre-production, after which PV module production, operation, installation geography, and finally recycling/disposal are also included. The embodied energy requirement, energy payback time (EPBT), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for crystalline silicon PV technologies were reviewed, summarised and evaluated. All environmental impact results were further discussed to highlight existing constraints in previous LCA studies. Both sc-Si and mc-Si share Siemens process during manufacturing, however sc-Si requires the additional Czochralski process which results in higher embodied energy requirement and EPBT for sc-Si technology. Therefore while sc-Si retains a higher conversion efficiency, this increased electrical energy output for a given surface area is still not enough to lower sc-Si's EPBT to levels comparable to ms-Si. Higher conversion efficiency however means that sc-Si panels outperform mc-Si on space efficiency. A set of recommendations for further work form the concluding parts of this work, in particular full examination of LCA of hybrid c-Si given that it combines the best features of sc- and mc-Si PVs, and currently, there is very little data available on hybrid c-Si.},

abstract = {This study assessed the impact of (Photo-Voltaic) PV battery systems on peak demand and energy consumption, and thus bill savings across households under two existing and nine potential electricity tariffs. Using case studies of old and new houses, we found an installation of 5.5 kW PV reduced the peak demand of the old houses from the grid by 16.5{\%}, 14.9{\%} and 10.9{\%} respectively in Townsville, Sydney and Melbourne, Australia respectively. The corresponding decreased in its annual electricity consumption from the grid were 84{\%}, 82{\%} and 163{\%}. The peak demand reduction of the new houses were less than that of the old houses, whilst the annual electricity consumption reductions were larger. Adding 16 kWh battery storage more than doubled the peak demand reduction in Townsville and Melbourne. We also found that, with PV alone, households on tariff of flat rate retail energy and network capacity charge had the greatest bill savings for both houses in the three cities. With adoption of PV battery systems, the greatest savings occurred at the households on tariff of critical peak pricing retail energy and network capacity charge. This information is useful for cost-effective use of renewable energy in residential buildings.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new modeling approach to quantify building energy performance in early design stages. Building simulation models can accurately quantify building energy loads, but are not amenable to the early design stages when architects need an assessment tool that can provide rapid feedback based on changes to high level design parameters. We utilize EnergyPlus, an existing whole building energy simulation program, within a Monte Carlo framework to develop a multivariate linear regression model based on 27 building parameters relevant to the early design stages. Because energy performance is sensitive to building size, geometry, and location, we model a medium-sized, rectangular office building and perform the regression in four different cities-Miami, Winston-Salem, Albuquerque, and Minneapolis-each representing a different climate zone. With the exception of heating in Miami, all R 2 values obtained from the multivariate regressions exceeded 96{\%}, which indicates an excellent fit to the EnergyPlus simulation results. The analysis suggests that a linear regression model can serve as the basis for an effective decision support tool in place of energy simulation models during early design stages. In addition, we present standardized regression coefficients to quantify the sensitivity of heating, cooling, and total energy loads to building design parameters across the four climate zones. The standardized regression coefficients can be used directly by designers to target building design parameters in early design that drive energy performance. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Gilmore2010,
abstract = {In a restructured electricity market, utility-scale energy storage technologies such as advanced batteries can generate revenue by charging at low electricity prices and discharging at high prices. This strategy changes the magnitude and distribution of air quality emissions and the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We evaluate the social costs associated with these changes using a case study of 500MW sodium–sulfur battery installations with 80{\%} round-trip efficiency. The batteries displace peaking generators in New York City and charge using off-peak generation in the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) electricity grid during the summer. We identify and map charging and displaced plant types to generators in the NYISO. We then convert the emissions into ambient concentrations with a chemical transport model, the Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (PMCAMx). Finally, we transform the concentrations into their equivalent human health effects and social benefits and costs. Reductions in premature mortality from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) result in a benefit of 4.5¢kWh−1 and 17¢kWh−1 from displacing a natural gas and distillate fuel oil fueled peaking plant, respectively, in New York City. Ozone (O3) concentrations increase due to decreases in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, although the magnitude of the social cost is less certain. Adding the costs from charging, displacing a distillate fuel oil plant yields a net social benefit, while displacing the natural gas plant has a net social cost. With the existing base-load capacity, the upstate population experiences an increase in adverse health effects. If wind generation is charging the battery, both the upstate charging location and New York City benefit. At {\$}20 per tonne of CO2, the costs from CO2 are small compared to those from air quality. We conclude that storage could be added to existing electricity grids as part of an integrated strategy from a human health standpoint.},

abstract = {Publicly Available Specification 2050-2011 (PAS 2050), the Green House Gas Product Protocol (GHGPP) standard and forthcoming guideline 14067 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have helped to propel carbon footprinting from a subdiscipline of life cycle assessment (LCA) to the mainstream. However, application of carbon footprinting to large portfolios of many distinct products and services is immensely resource intensive. Even if achieved, it often fails to inform company-wide carbon reduction strategies because footprint data are disjointed or don't cover the whole portfolio. We introduce a novel approach to generate standard-compliant product carbon footprints (CFs) for companies with large portfolios at a fraction of previously required time and expertise. The approach was developed and validated on an LCA dataset covering 1,137 individual products from a global packaged consumer goods company. Three novel techniques work in concert in a single approach that enables practitioners to calculate thousands of footprints virtually simultaneously: (i) a uniform data structure enables footprinting all products and services by looping the same algorithm; (ii) concurrent uncertainty analysis guides practitioners to gradually improve the accuracy of only those data that materially impact the results; and (iii) a predictive model generates estimated emission factors (EFs) for materials, thereby eliminating the manual mapping of a product or service's inventory to EF databases. These autogenerated EFs enable non-LCA experts to calculate approximate CFs and alleviate resource constraints for companies embarking on large-scale product carbon footprinting. We discuss implementation roadmaps for companies, including further road-testing required to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach for other product portfolios, limitations, and future improvements of the fast footprinting methodology.},

abstract = {The development and transfer of clean energy technologies to achieve universal energy access is challenging due to the inherent complexities of the energy sector, and the energy governance and financial systems in developing economies. Innovation is an essential part of successfully addressing these difficulties. Duplicating the energy infrastructure models of developed countries will not be sufficient to meet the needs of poor consumers. To the extent that innovation can accelerate energy access, it is important to understand the specific types of innovations that are necessary and how they might be facilitated. The general features of existing international clean energy innovation systems, which are predominantly driven by the markets and emissions reduction mechanisms of developed and rapidly growing emerging economies, are reviewed and the alignment of these sys- tems to the innovation processes required to extend energy access globally is evaluated. Drawing on the innovation policy literature, the attributes of effective international and domestic energy innovation systems that are pro-poor and the associated policy approaches are identified. Policy relevance While energy innovation for climate mitigation suffers from insufficient policy attention, even less attention has been given to energy innovation for energy access for the poor. Four policy approaches to better link energy innovation frameworks to energy access objectives are identified. First, contextually-appropriate, pro-poor policy approaches to innovation should be prioritized over hardware-centric approaches. Second, enabling environments for entrepreneurs should be cultivated. Third, policies should target the enhancement of innovation capabilities, with a particular focus on organizational capital and networks of firms and other actors. Lastly, novel technology transfer pathways, in particular South–South pathways, should be explored. These approaches may have more potential for pro-poor innovation than traditional North–South transfers of technology, because they are rooted in the energy services needs of the poor and more geared to address pro-poor issues than the innovation priorities of developed countries are.

abstract = {The paper presents the operational results of a real life residential microgrid which includes six apartments, a 20kWp photovoltaic plant, a solar based thermal energy plant, a geothermal heat pump, a thermal energy storage, in the form of a 1300l water tank and two 5.8kWh batteries supplying, each, a couple of apartments. Thanks to the thermal energy storage, the solar based thermal energy plant is able to satisfy the 100{\%} of the hot water summer demand. Therefore the thermal energy storage represents a fundamental element in the management of the residential demand of thermal energy. It collects renewable thermal energy during day-time to release it during night-time, effectively shaving the peak of the thermal energy demand. The two electric storages, on the other hand, provide the hosted electrical subsystems with the ability to effectively increase the self-consumption of the local energy production, thus lowering the amount of energy surplus to be sold back to the grid, and increasing the self-sufficiency of the microgrid. For instance, the storage has supported self-consumption up to the 58.1{\%} of local energy production with regard to the first battery, and up to the 63.5{\%} with regard to the second one. Also, 3165 and 3365 yearly hours of fully autonomous activity have been recorded thanks to the first, and the second battery respectively. On the other hand, the yearly average efficiency amounts to 63.7{\%}, and 65.3{\%} respectively, for the first and second battery. In the second part of the paper we propose a computational framework to evaluate the overall performance of the microgrid system, while accounting different operating conditions and energy management policies. From this perspective, the framework acts as a useful modeling and design tool, to assess the opportunity of employing alternative energy management system topologies and strategies. Eight different configurations, with growing complexity, have been derived from the original system on purpose. The simulations, carried out based on real data related to one-year time period, have provided results showing that, the higher the integration level of electrical and thermal storage is, the higher degree of self-sufficiency can be achieved by the microgrid, and, in turn, the more consistent the yearly energy saving become. Nevertheless, despite the energy cost reduction achievable with the availability of storage systems in the Leaf House, their high investment cost made them not really profitable at the current price conditions for devices and energy purchase.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to model a hybrid power system for buildings, which is technically feasible and economically optimal. With a view to promote renewable energy sources, photovoltaics and wind turbines are integrated with the grid connected building. The system is modeled and the optimal system configuration is estimated with the help of hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER). The logic is illustrated with a case study based on the practical data of a building located in southern India. This building is associated with 3.4 MWh/day priority load (peak load as 422 kW), as well as 3.3 MWh/day deferrable load (peak load as 500 kW). Sensitivity analysis is performed to deal with uncertainties such as the increase in electricity consumption and grid tariff, environmental changes, etc. From the simulation result, it is observed that the designed system is cost effective and environment friendly, which leads to 6.18 {\%} annual cost savings and reduces CO2 emissions by 38.3 {\%}. Sensitivity results indicate that the system is optimal and adaptable in a certain range of unanticipated variances with respect to best estimated value. Finally, an energy management strategy is developed for the optimal system to ensure reliable power during contingency and disturbances. The green and hybrid power system designed can be adaptable to any critical and large consumers of urban buildings.},

abstract = {This article presents the modeling, simulation, and sizing results of battery energy storage systems for residential electricity peak shaving. Realistic 5min time-step electricity profiles were input to an energy storage model with the objective of reducing the peak electricity demand seen by the electricity grid. The model simulates and provides performance results of a range of battery and inverter sizes specific to a variety of residential houses. The results suggest typical system sizes range from 5kWh/2.6kW for low electricity intensity homes to 22kWh/5.2kW for electricity intense homes with electric space heating. Based on the resulting storage system cycling profile and data provided by other researchers, the battery life is estimated to be in the range of 10–20 years for this application.},

abstract = {Buildings consume more than one third of the world's total primary energy. Weather plays a unique and significant role as it directly affects the thermal loads and thus energy performance of buildings. The traditional simulated energy performance using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather data represents the building performance for a typical year, but not necessarily the average or typical long-term performance as buildings with different energy systems and designs respond differently to weather changes. Furthermore, the single-year TMY simulations do not provide a range of results that capture yearly variations due to changing weather, which is important for building energy management, and for performing risk assessments of energy efficiency investments. This paper employs large-scale building simulation (a total of 3162 runs) to study the weather impact on peak electricity demand and energy use with the 30-year (1980-2009) Actual Meteorological Year (AMY) weather data for three types of office buildings at two design efficiency levels, across all 17 ASHRAE climate zones. The simulated results using the AMY data are compared to those from the TMY3 data to determine and analyze the differences. Besides further demonstration, as done by other studies, that actual weather has a significant impact on both the peak electricity demand and energy use of buildings, the main findings from the current study include: (1) annual weather variation has a greater impact on the peak electricity demand than it does on energy use in buildings; (2) the simulated energy use using the TMY3 weather data is not necessarily representative of the average energy use over a long period, and the TMY3 results can be significantly higher or lower than those from the AMY data; (3) the weather impact is greater for buildings in colder climates than warmer climates; (4) the weather impact on the medium-sized office building was the greatest, followed by the large office and then the small office; and (5) simulated energy savings and peak demand reduction by energy conservation measures using the TMY3 weather data can be significantly underestimated or overestimated. It is crucial to run multi-decade simulations with AMY weather data to fully assess the impact of weather on the long-term performance of buildings, and to evaluate the energy savings potential of energy conservation measures for new and existing buildings from a life cycle perspective. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid power (V2G) uses electric-drive vehicles (battery, fuel cell, or hybrid) to provide power for specific electric markets. This article examines the systems and processes needed to tap energy in vehicles and implement V2G. It quantitatively compares today's light vehicle fleet with the electric power system. The vehicle fleet has 20 times the power capacity, less than one-tenth the utilization, and one-tenth the capital cost per prime mover kW. Conversely, utility generators have 10-50 times longer operating life and lower operating costs per kWh. To tap V2G is to synergistically use these complementary strengths and to reconcile the complementary needs of the driver and grid manager. This article suggests strategies and business models for doing so, and the steps necessary for the implementation of V2G. After the initial high-value, V2G markets saturate and production costs drop, V2G can provide storage for renewable energy generation. Our calculations suggest that V2G could stabilize large-scale (one-half of US electricity) wind power with 3{\%} of the fleet dedicated to regulation for wind, plus 8-38{\%} of the fleet providing operating reserves or storage for wind. Jurisdictions more likely to take the lead in adopting V2G are identified. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These scenarios are applied to the waste amount and composition of the Municipality of Roma (Italy) and are evaluated under different points of view: global and local emissions, total material demands, total energy requirements and ecological footprints. Results, reliable for most of the European big cities, show landfill systems as the worst waste management options and significant environmental savings at global scale are achieved from undertaking energy recycling. Furthermore, waste treatments finalized to energy recovery provide an energy output that, in the best case, is able to meet the 15{\%} of Roma electricity consumption.},

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {Urban governments are continually striving to improve air quality by making public transportation more environmentally friendly. H2 fuel cell buses (FCBs) offer one of the best ways to reduce air pollution. FCB has high energy efficiency and lower air pollutant emissions than conventional buses (e.g. diesel bus/Compressed natural gas bus, CNGB), and H2 is an attractive alternative energy source in the face of depleting fossil fuels and global warming. H2 can be produced via fossil fuels and renewable sources and then stored and distributed in a variety of different ways. While many contend that H2 and FCB are not yet commercially viable, H2 technology has developed a great deal over recent years. This fact alone demands that governments as well as for-profit businesses take a discerning look at what H2 and FCB have to offer in terms of both environmental and economic opportunities.  In this study, environmental and economic aspects of hydrogen pathways are analyzed according to plausible production methods and capacity, and distribution options in Korea using life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methods. This study considers the following means of hydrogen production: naphtha steam reforming (Naphtha SR), natural gas steam reforming (NG SR), and water electrolysis (WE). Additionally, conventional fuels (Diesel and CNG) are also included as target fuel pathways in order to identify which hydrogen pathway in particular has the greatest environmental advantage over conventional fuels. This study aimed to identify whether H2 and FCB can compete with conventional fuels used in buses in terms of the eco-efficiency method, which focuses on economic feasibility and environmental improvement.  The conclusion of this study is that H2 pathways, especially, Naphtha SR [C] and NG SR [S], are more competitive than conventional fuels from an eco-efficiency perspective. As a result, switching from conventional transportation fuel to these suggested H2 pathways is expected to offer an economically and environmentally more eco-efficient means of transportation. Henceforth, drawing upon evidence within this report, decision-makers would be wise to invest in more cost-effective and environment-friendly fuels by constructing an optimal H2 infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive literature review and a full process-based life-cycle analysis (LCA) of three types of batteries, viz., (1) valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), (2) flow-assisted nickel–zinc (NiZn), and (3) non-flow manganese dioxide–zinc (MnO2/Zn) for stationary-grid applications. We used the Ecoinvent life-cycle inventory (LCI) databases for the VRLA battery, coupled with inventory data from the CUNY Energy Institute (EI) for the NiZn and MnO2/Zn batteries under development there. In doing so, two indicators were tracked: the cumulative energy demand (CED) and global warming potential (GWP) of the upstream processes for producing, manufacturing, and transporting the finished product, as well as the effects of end-of-life impacts. We conducted a normalization of CED and GWP according to Wh of battery capacity to illustrate the effects of discharge rate on this commonly reported metric. We subsequently normalized according to the cumulative kWh of electricity throughput (kWhthroughput) to account for cycle life and efficiency data. This was done considering slow- and fast-discharge parameters for PbA chemistry and for current- and projected- parameters for the NiZn and MnO2/Zn chemistries to examine all possible effects. Additionally, the effects of recycle content on reducing CED and GWP were considered. Discharge rate was seen to have a significant effect for the VRLA system, with impacts over 41–46{\%} higher in terms of CED and GWP at the 2-h discharge time, versus an 8-h discharge time, when considering the entire life cycle (kWhthroughput normalization). With kWhthroughput normalization, the NiZn- chemistry under development has lower CED and GWP than PbA-VRLA batteries for both current and projected targets of round-trip efficiency and cycle life. MnO2/Zn performs poorer than VRLA currently (41–52{\%} higher CED and 35–38{\%} higher GWP), but performs significantly better than VRLA when using projected targets (43{\%} lower CED and 47{\%} lower GWP). The energy requirement for battery production and transport is most significant for PbA and MnO2/Zn batteries. This is the case for PbA due to its relatively short service life– and this battery was found to be most sensitive to changes in battery service life and efficiency. For MnO2/Zn this was a result of low specific energy.},

abstract = {This paper aims to examine the sustainability and environmental performance of PV-based electricity generation systems by conducting a thorough review of the life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of five common photovoltaic (PV) systems, i.e., mono-crystalline (mono-Si), multi-crystalline (multi-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si), CdTe thin film (CdTe) and CIS thin film (CIS), and some advanced PV systems. The results show that, among the five common PV systems, the CdTe PV system presents the best environmental performance in terms of energy payback time (EPBT) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission rate due to its low life-cycle energy requirement and relatively high conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, the mono-Si PV system demonstrates the worst because of its high energy intensity during the solar cells' production process. The EPBT and GHG emission rate of thin film PV systems are within the range of 0.75-3.5 years and 10.5-50 g CO2-eq./kW h, respectively. In general, the EPBT of mono-Si PV systems range from 1.7 to 2.7 years with GHG emission rate from 29 to 45 g CO2-eq./kW h, which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of fossil-based electricity. This paper also reviews the EPBT and GHG emission rates of some advanced PV systems, such as high-concentration, heterojunction and dye-sensitized technologies. The EBPT of high-concentration PV system is lower, ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 years, but the CO2 emission rate of dye-sensitized PV system is higher than the ones of other PV systems at the moment. The LCA results show that PV technologies are already proved to be very sustainable and environmental-friendly in the state of the art. With the emerging of new manufacturing technologies, the environmental performance of PV technologies is expected to be further improved in the near future. In addition, considering the existing limitations in the previous LCA studies, a few suggestions are recommended. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Given photovoltaics' (PVs) constant improvements in terms of material usage and energy efficiency, this paper provides a timely update on their life-cycle energy and environmental performance. Single-crystalline Si (sc-Si), multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) systems are analysed, considering the actual country of production and adapting the input electricity mix accordingly. Energy pay-back time (EPBT) results for fixed-tilt ground mounted installations range from 0.5 years for CdTe PV at high-irradiation (2300 kWh/(m2{\textperiodcentered}yr)) to 2.8 years for sc-Si PV at low-irradiation (1000 kWh/(m2{\textperiodcentered}yr)), with corresponding quality-adjusted energy return on investment (EROIPE-eq) values ranging from over 60 to {\~{}}10. Global warming potential (GWP) per kWhel averages out at {\~{}}30 g(CO2-eq), with lower values (down to {\~{}}10 g) for CdTe PV at high irradiation, and up to {\~{}}80 g for Chinese sc-Si PV at low irradiation. In general, results point to CdTe PV as the best performing technology from an environmental life-cycle perspective, also showing a remarkable improvement for current production modules in comparison with previous generations. Finally, we determined that one-axis tracking installations can improve the environmental profile of PV systems by approximately 10{\%} for most impact metrics.},

Con Edison's preemptive maintenance programs are less than a decade old and are made more effective with the use of analytics developing alongside them. Some of the data we used for our projects are historical records dating as far back as the 1880s, and some of the data are free-text documents typed by Con Edison dispatchers. The operational goals of this work are to assist with Con Edison's preemptive inspection and repair program and its vented-cover replacement program.

abstract = {Implementing demand response (DR) in commercial buildings can play a major role in reducing building's peak load. This improves the efficiency of electricity grids and mitigates expensive peak demand/energy charges for buildings. Due to the lack of Energy Management Systems, small and medium-sized commercial buildings have not historically played much role as a DR resource. This paper presents an integrated control of major loads in commercial buildings, i.e., cooling, lighting and plug loads that can maintain occupant environmental preferences. Each zone's space temperature set points are optimally adjusted to maintain thermal comfort. Lighting levels, with and without daylight availability, are tightly controlled to maintain desired illuminance levels. Unlike other studies, this research contributes to improvement in functionalities of EnergyPlus by incorporating a 1-min resolution data set at the individual plug load level. The research evaluates total building performance including interdependencies between lighting, plug load, HVAC and control systems interacting in a realistic manner, both among themselves and with building occupants. In this paper, a method to determine the DR potential of a building, i.e., the amount of electrical demand (kW) by load type that can be shifted or shed, is discussed.},

abstract = {In electricity markets, traditional demand side management programs are slowly getting replaced with demand response (DR) programs. These programs have evolved since the early pilot programs launched in late 1990s. With the changes in market rules the opportunities have generally increased for DR for participating in emergency, economic and ancillary service programs. In recent times, various regulators have suggested that DR can also be used as a solution to meet supply - demand fluctuations in scenarios with significant penetration of variable renewable sources in grid. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the DR programs in PJM and NYISO markets as well as analyzes current opportunities. Although DR participation has grown, most of the current participation is in the reliability programs, which are designed to provide load curtailment during peak days. This suggests that there is a significant gap between perception of ability of DR to mitigate variability of renewables and reality of current participation. DR in future can be scaled to play a more dynamic role in electricity markets, but that would require changes both on technology as well as policy front. Advances in building technologies and energy storage combined with appropriate price signals can lead to enhanced DR participation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Such life-cycle analyses of energy technologies are essential, especially as material and energy flows are often interwoven, and divergent emissions into the environment may occur at different life-cycle-stages. This approach is well exemplified by our description of material and energy flows in four commercial PV technologies, i.e., mono-crystalline silicon, multi-crystalline silicon, ribbon-silicon, and cadmium telluride. The same life-cycle approach is applied to the balance of system that supports flat, fixed PV modules during operation. We also discuss the life-cycle environmental metrics for a concentration PV system with a tracker and lenses to capture more sunlight per cell area than the flat, fixed system but requires large auxiliary components. Select life-cycle risk indicators for PV, i.e., fatalities, injures, and maximum consequences are evaluated in a comparative context with other electricity-generation pathways.},

abstract = {Low-income households contend with high energy costs and poor thermal comfort due to poor structural conditions and energy inefficiencies in their homes. Energy efficiency upgrades can potentially reduce energy expenses and improve thermal comfort, while also addressing problematic issues in the home environment. The present mixed method pilot study explored the impacts of energy efficiency upgrades in 20 households in a low-income community in New York City. Surveys and interviews were administered to the heads of household in a variety of housing types. Interviews were also conducted with landlords of buildings that had recently undergone upgrades. Findings indicate that energy efficiency measures resulted in improved thermal comfort, enhanced health and safety and reduced energy costs. Participants reported largely positive experiences with the upgrades, resulting in direct and indirect benefits. However, results also indicate negative consequences associated with the upgrades and further illustrate that weatherization alone was insufficient to address all of the issues facing low-income households. Moreover, qualitative results revealed differing experiences of low-income renters compared to homeowners. Overall, energy efficiency upgrades are a promising intervention to mitigate the energy and structurally related challenges facing low-income households, but larger scale research is needed to capture the long-term implications of these upgrades.},

abstract = {In future electricity systems with a high share of intermittent renewable power generation, battery technologies have the potential to support power quality and security. The growing scientific literature on batteries reflects the high attention that currently rests on these technologies. This paper reviews the existing literature on lifecycle costs of batteries in stationary applications. The primary result of this review is that, despite the current high degree of variance in technological and economic battery data, a systematic assessment of the underlying uncertainty is lacking. The present paper addresses this disparity with an investigation of the impact of uncertainty in input parameters on lifecycle costs of four battery technologies across six electricity system applications. Based on input data collected from literature and via expert interviews, a probabilistic techno-economic model was built that calculates lifecycle costs and systematically addresses uncertainty in input parameters by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion of this paper is that the present uncertainty in cost and technical parameters of batteries exceeds by far the differences in lifecycle costs across technologies. For most electricity storage applications, the absolute differences in mean lifecycle costs across technologies are negligible compared to the uncertainty ranges of the mean lifecycle costs. Therefore, a competition still exists between the four analyzed battery technologies and so far a leading technology has yet to emerge in any of the investigated applications.},

abstract = {Price volatility and increasing renewable energy generation have raised interest in the potential opportunities for storage technologies in energy-only electricity markets. In this paper we explore the value of a price-taking storage device in such a market, the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia. Our analysis suggests that under optimal operation, there is little value in having more than six hours of storage in this market. However, an inability to perfectly forecast wholesale prices, particularly extreme price spikes, may warrant some additional storage. We found that storage devices effectively provide a similar service to peak generators and are similarly dependent on and exposed to extreme price events, with revenue for a merchant generator highly skewed to a few days of the year. As a consequence of this finding, and in contrast to previous studies, the value of storage was found to be relatively insensitive to the round trip efficiency. We also found that the variability of revenue and exposure to extreme prices could be reduced using common hedging strategies, such as those currently used by peak generators. We present a case study that demonstrates storage technologies using such strategies may have a competitive advantage over other peaking generators in the NEM, due to the ability to earn revenue outside of extreme peak events. Similar to traditional peak generators, a main driver for storage options in an energy-only electricity market is extreme prices, which in turn is dependent on capacity requirements. However storage technologies can receive additional revenue streams, which may be improved by increased integration of renewable energy.},

We present a four-metric framework to identify priority regions to deploy and dispatch these technologies to displace marginal grid air emissions with high environmental and health impacts. To the standard metrics of total mass and rate of air pollutant emissions we add location and time, to prioritize emission displacement near densely populated areas with poor air quality, especially at times when air pollutant concentrations exceed regulatory standards. We illustrate our framework with a case study using storage, demand response, and other technologies to displace peaker power plants, the highest-rate marginal emitters on the California grid. We combine spatial-temporal data on plant electricity generation, air quality standard exceedance days, and population characteristics available from environmental justice screening tool CalEnviroScreen 2.0 to determine where emissions reductions may have the greatest marginal benefit. This screening approach can inform grid siting decisions, such as storage in lieu of peaker plants in high impact regions, or dispatch protocol, such as triggering demand response instead of peaker plants on poor air quality days.},

abstract = {Self-consumption of on-site photovoltaic (PV) electricity in buildings is gaining interest as a way to accommodate high PV penetrations in the power system. On markets where there is no substantial feed-in support for renewables, there is also an economic incentive for PV self-consumption, as selling prices for PV electricity are normally lower than retail electricity prices. One option for improved self-consumption is rescheduling of programmable appliances, typically washing machines, clothes dryers and dishwashers. This paper determines the potential to increase PV self-consumption through scheduling of these appliances in Swedish single-family buildings. Simulations of daily load scheduling were performed to match on-site PV power generation and recent (2008–2012) hourly electricity market prices, using a set of high-resolution (10-min) appliance load profiles from 200 monitored Swedish households. Since these data provide appliance ownership and daily appliance use patterns in a wide range of households, a realistic upper limit to the self-consumption potential is obtained. The conclusions are that load shifting can potentially increase PV self-consumption by around 200 kWh on average, corresponding to a few percent of the total PV power generation for the system sizes studied (3–9 kWp). The maximum economic benefit over the studied years was 20EUR per year and household. For the larger PV system sizes that could inject critical peak powers to the distribution grid, the peak hourly PV surplus decreased less than a few percent. The main conclusion is that there is an overall low potential for improved self-consumption through optimal scheduling of the studied appliances, at least with the current Swedish market conditions.},

abstract = {While life cycle assessment (LCA) has been recognized as an invaluable tool to assess the energy and environmental profiles of a photovoltaic (PV) system, current LCA studies are limited to Europe and North America. However, today most PV modules are outsourced to and manufactured in non-OECD countries (e.g., China), which have a substantially different degree of industrialization and environmental restriction. To investigate this issue, we perform a comparative LCA between domestic and overseas manufacturing scenarios illustrated by three kinds of silicon-based PV technologies, namely mono-crystalline silicon, multi-crystalline silicon and ribbon silicon. We take into account geographic diversity by utilizing localized inventory data for processes and materials. The energy payback time, energy return on investment and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for both scenarios are calculated and analyzed. Compared to the domestic manufacturing scenario, the energy use efficiency is generally 30{\%} lower and the carbon footprint is almost doubled in the overseas manufacturing scenario. Moreover, based on the LCA results, we propose a break-even carbon tariff model for the international trade of silicon-based PV modules, indicating an appropriate carbon tariff in the range of €105-€129/ton CO2. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The current IEA guidelines were$\backslash$ndeveloped to provide guidance on assuring consistency, balance, and quality to enhance the$\backslash$ncredibility and reliability of the results from photovoltaic (PV) LCAs. The guidelines represent$\backslash$na consensus among the authors, PV LCA experts in North America, Europe, and Asia, for$\backslash$nassumptions made on PV performance, process input and emissions allocation, methods of$\backslash$nanalysis, and reporting of the results.$\backslash$nGuidance is given on photovoltaic-specific parameters used as inputs in LCA and on choices$\backslash$nand assumptions in life cycle inventory (LCI) data analysis and on implementation of$\backslash$nmodeling approaches. A consistent approach towards system modeling, the functional unit,$\backslash$nthe system boundaries and the allocation aspects enhances the credibility of PV LCA studies$\backslash$nand enables balanced LCA-based comparisons of different energy life-cycles.$\backslash$nThe document discusses metrics like greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the cumulated energy demand (CED), the acidification potential (AP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), human toxicity, ecotoxicity and ionizing radiation. Guidance is given for the definition of the energy payback time (EPBT), the nonrenewable energy payback time (NREPBT), the energy return on investment (EROI) and the impact mitigation potentials (IMP). The guidelines on the reporting and communication of the results serve the need for producing clear and comprehensive reports. Transparency in reporting is of the utmost importance as parameters vary with geographical zones, and a system's boundary conditions and modeling approach can affect the findings significantly. At a minimum, the following parameters should be reported: 1) On-plane irradiation level and location; 2) module-rated efficiency; 3) system's performance ratio; 4) time-frame of data; 5) type of system (e.g., roof-top, ground mount fixed tilt or tracker); 6) expected lifetime and degradation ratio for PV and BOS; 7) system's boundaries (whether capital goods, installation, maintenance, disposal, the transportation- and recycling-stages$\backslash$nare included for both PV modules and balance-of-system (frame, mounting, cabling, inverter; for utility applications the transformer, site preparation, and maintenance)); 8) the place/country/region of production modeled (e.g., average grid, site specific power use (e.g., hydro, coal), and 9) explicit goal of the study (e.g., static or prospective LCA, prototype or commercial production, current performance or expected future development). These parameters should be listed in the captions of figures showing the results of the LCA. In addition, the report should identify the following: The LCA method used, especially if is not process-based; the LCA tool (e.g., Simapro, Gabi, other); databases used (e.g., Ecoinvent, GaBi, ELCD, Franklin, NREL, other); the energy payback time calculation method; commercial representativeness of the study (required if the data are from a pilot-scale production), and assumptions for production of major input materials, e.g. solar grade silicon, aluminum (primary and/or secondary production).},

abstract = {The last five years have been one of the most exciting times for the energy storage industry. We have seen significant advancements in the regulatory process to make accommodations for valuing and monetizing energy storage for what it provides to the grid. The most impactful regulatory decision for the energy storage industry has come from California, where the California Public Utilities Commission issued a decision that mandates procurement requirements of 1.325 GW for energy storage to three investor-owned utilities in four stages in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020. Furthermore, at the federal level, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) Order 755 requires transmission operators to develop pay-for-performance tariffs for ancillary services. This has had a direct impact on the market design of U.S. competitive wholesale markets and the monetization of fast-responding grid assets. While this order is technology neutral, it clearly plays into the fast-responding capability of energy storage technologies. Today, PJM, CAISO, MISO, NYISO, and NE-ISO have implemented Order 755 and offer new tariff-for-regulation services based on pay-for-performance principles. Furthermore, FERC Order 784, which was issued in July 2013, requires transmission providers to consider speed and accuracy in determining the requirements for ancillary services. In November 2013, FERC issued Order 972, which revises the small generator interconnection agreement that declares energy storage as a power source. This order puts energy storage on par with existing generators.

abstract = {Dynamic simulation is used in new buildings and renovations with the purpose to predict their thermal-energy performance, typically assuming a standard use of the buildings. Even if the role of occupants' behavior is widely acknowledged to be a key factor influencing energy consumption in buildings, these predictive models are not used to quantify specific benefits deriving from precise occupants' actions. In this work, a numerical–experimental campaign is carried out in a village of green buildings in central Italy, where the most innovative and efficient technologies are already implemented and, therefore, where further physical active or passive retrofits would not be cost-effective. This work demonstrates that, through a sophisticated theoretical–experimental modeling of a residential village, a substantial further energy saving is still to be achieved through zero-cost simple actions, i.e. human-based energy retrofits. Ordinary actions of energy waste reduction are described within the physical model with the final purpose to quantify the effect of occupancy operations considered at the same level of traditional physical retrofit scenarios. The combination of these human-based energy retrofits produces an annual personal primary energy saving of 239kWh/person in the village, and a corresponding annual money saving of 84€/person. This work shows that, when theoretical dynamic simulation models are performed in order to investigate buildings' thermal-energy behavior and predict the cost-benefit efficacy of common physical energy retrofits, simple and effective human-based energy retrofits should be considered at the same level of physical retrofits, and even before them, for their intrinsic technical and economical efficacy.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to model a hybrid power system for buildings, which is technically feasible and economically optimal. With a view to promote renewable energy sources, photovoltaics and wind turbines are integrated with the grid connected building. The system is modeled and the optimal system configuration is estimated with the help of hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER). The logic is illustrated with a case study based on the practical data of a building located in southern India. This building is associated with 3.4 MWh/day priority load (peak load as 422 kW), as well as 3.3 MWh/day deferrable load (peak load as 500 kW). Sensitivity analysis is performed to deal with uncertainties such as the increase in electricity consumption and grid tariff, environmental changes, etc. From the simulation result, it is observed that the designed system is cost effective and environment friendly, which leads to 6.18 {\%} annual cost savings and reduces CO2 emissions by 38.3 {\%}. Sensitivity results indicate that the system is optimal and adaptable in a certain range of unanticipated variances with respect to best estimated value. Finally, an energy management strategy is developed for the optimal system to ensure reliable power during contingency and disturbances.

This paper carries out systematic orthogonal experiments to extract key stress factor of capacity loss for commercial LiCoO2/MCMB (mesocarbon microbeads) lithium ion batteries cycled in shallow-depth discharge. Further, single stress factor and multi-stress factor models consisting of temperature, discharge rate, taper voltage and depth of discharge for cycle life prediction of lithium ion batteries are developed. The physicochemical significance of the life prediction model is interpreted by electrochemical analysis. The practical applicability of the models is validated by experimental data.

The target renewable energy system is made up of CdTe PV panel, a power conditioning system and a balance of system. Life-cycle environmental issues were analyzed using major indicators like global warming potential, fossil fuel consumption, energy payback time, and CO2 payback time. Then, the results were compared with those of alternative PV systems such as single- and multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaics. The CdTe PV systems presently have a GWP of 15.1g CO2 equivalent/kWh in Malaysia. The CdTe PV panel is the greatest contributor to global warming potential in the system, accounting for 47.8{\%}. Electricity used in the semiconductor deposition process is the major contributor of GWP in CdTe PV panel. Total fossil fuel consumption is 0.221MJ/kWh. The CdTe PV panel accounts for 49.3{\%} of the total fossil fuel consumption. Energy payback time and CO2 payback time are 0.94years and 0.76years, respectively, and those are relatively short periods compared with other PV power plants. The energy return on investment of the CdTe PV system was found to be superior to other Si-based PV systems.},

abstract = {Post-occupancy research shows that only 11{\%} of commercial buildings met the ASHRAE thermal comfort standard. Many buildings are too warm in winter and/or too cool in summer, wasting energy and not providing comfort. We investigate potential energy savings in U.S. offices and restaurants if thermostat settings are changed according the updated ASHRAE 55-2013 comfort model that accounts for outdoor temperature and clothing choice for different climate zones. We develop eQUEST building models calibrated to reproduce energy consumption statistics. Changes in energy consumption due to the new settings are analyzed for 14 cities, results are extrapolated to estimate potential national savings. We find that, depending on the climate zone, each degree increase in the summer saves 0.6{\%} to 0.5{\%} of total building electricity consumption. Each degree the winter setting is lowered saves 1.2{\%}–8.7{\%} of total building natural gas consumption. With new thermostat settings, national savings are 2.5{\%} of the total consumed in all office buildings and restaurants, summing up to national savings of 69.6 million GJ annually, comparable to all 2015 total solar PV generation in U.S. The goals of improved comfort and energy/economic savings are thus co-aligned, raising the importance of thermostat management as an energy efficiency strategy.},

abstract = {With the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transportation sector, policy-makers are supporting a multitude of measures to increase electric vehicle adoption. The actual level of emission reduction associated with the electrification of the transport sector is dependent on the contexts that determine when and where drivers charge electric vehicles. This analysis contributes to our understanding of the degree to which a particular electricity grid profile, vehicle type, and charging patterns impact CO2 emissions from light-duty, plug-in electric vehicles. We present an analysis of emissions resulting from both battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for four charging scenarios and five electricity grid profiles. A scenario that allows drivers to charge electric vehicles at the workplace yields the lowest level of emissions for the majority of electricity grid profiles. However, vehicle emissions are shown to be highly dependent on the percentage of fossil fuels in the grid mix, with different vehicle types and charging scenarios resulting in fewer emissions when the carbon intensity of the grid is above a defined level. Restricting charging to off-peak hours results in higher total emissions for all vehicle types, as compared to other charging scenarios.},

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used as the analytical tool to evaluate the environmental consequences of landfilling holistically. The economic implications of the control methods are also briefly assessed. The results show that in terms of GHG emissions as well as in terms of economics, it is more advantageous to have a large centralized landfill and produce electricity from the LFG rather than having several small, localized landfills despite significantly lower transportation requirement for the latter case. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the global warming potential was sensitive to gas collection efficiency as well as methane oxidation rate in the landfill.

@article{Schiffer2007,
abstract = {Predicting the lifetime of lead-acid batteries in applications with irregular operating conditions such as partial state-of-charge cycling, varying depth-of-discharge and different times between full charging is known as a difficult task. Experimental investigations in the laboratory are difficult because each application has its own specific operation profile. Therefore, an experimental investigation is necessary for each application and, moreover, for each operation strategy. This paper presents a lifetime model that allows comparison of the impact of different operating conditions, different system sizing and different battery technologies on battery lifetime. It is a tool for system designers and system operators to select appropriate batteries, to do a proper system design (sizing of the battery, power generators and loads), and to implement an optimized operation strategy (end-of-charge voltage, frequency of full charging, gassing periods, maximum depth-of-discharge). The model is a weighted Ah throughput approach based on the assumption that operating conditions are typically more severe than those used in standard tests of cycling and float lifetime. The wear depends on the depth-of-discharge, the current rate, the existing acid stratification, and the time since the last full charging. The actual Ah throughput is continuously multiplied by a weight factor that represents the actual operating conditions. Even though the modelling approach is mainly heuristic, all of the effects that are taken into account are based on a detailed analysis and understanding of ageing processes in lead-acid batteries. The 'normal' user can adapt the model to different battery types simply from the data sheet information on cycle lifetime and float lifetime. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
